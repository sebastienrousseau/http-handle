## Overview

The `http-handle` is a robust Rust library designed for serving static websites generated by the Shokunin Static Site Generator. It provides a simple yet efficient HTTP server implementation with features like request parsing, response generation, and basic security measures.

## Features

- **Static File Serving**: Serve static files from a configured document root.
- **Request Parsing**: Parse incoming HTTP requests with proper error handling.
- **Response Generation**: Generate appropriate HTTP responses based on requests.
- **Security Measures**: Prevent directory traversal attacks.
- **Content Type Detection**: Automatically detect and set appropriate content types for files.
- **Customizable 404 Handling**: Support for custom 404 error pages.
- **Threaded Connections**: Handle multiple connections concurrently using threads.
- **Configurable Server**: Easy configuration of server address and document root.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
http-handle = "0.0.1"
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `http-handle`:

```rust
use http_handle::Server;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let server = Server::new("127.0.0.1:8080", "./public");
    server.start()
}
```

This will start a server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080`, serving files from the `./public` directory.
